        Don't you notice how
       I get quiet when there's no one else around?
       Me and you and awkward silence
       Don't you dare look at me that way
       I don't need reminders of how you don't feel the same
       Oh, the burning pain

       Listening to you harp on 'bout some new soulmate
       "She'so perfect, " blah, blah, blah
      Oh, how I wish you'll wake up one day
       Run to me, confess your love, at least just let me say
      That when I talk to you oh, Cupid walks right through
      And shoots an arrow through my heart

     And I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too?
      Confess I loved you from the start
     What's a girl to do?
       Lying on my bed, staring into the bluе
     Unrequited, terrifying

       Lovе is driving me a bit insane
       Have to get this off my chest
     I'm telling you today 
     That when I talk to you, oh, Cupid walks right through
     And shoots an arrow through my heart

     And I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too?
       Confess I loved you from the start
      Confess I loved you
      Just thinking of you
     I know I've loved you from the start
