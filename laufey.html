<h1>About laufe</h1>
    <pre style="margin-left: 70px; ">As a musician, my goal is to bring jazz and classical music to my generation through a more accessible road,” declares the 
        composer, singer, producer,  and multi-instrumentalist Laufey. In 2022, the Icelandic-Chinese artist’s trailblazing approach paid off,
         with a performance on Jimmy Kimmel LIVE! in support of her first full-length
         Everything I Know About Love, sold out tours of North America, Asia,
          and Australia, and she was the most streamed jazz artist of the year on Spotify.

        The Los Angeles-based Laufey (pronounced lāy-vāy) continued her story by writing and recording Bewitched,
         her second album. Inspired by jazz greats andclassical masters while possessing
         a point of view that could only be conveyed by a 21st-century twentysomething, Bewitched represents an expansion 
         of Laufey’s sonic palette. Tracks  like the breezy bossa nova cut “From the Start”
          and the smoldering string-assisted ballad “Promise” have classic songcraft
           and intricate arrangements that make them feel instantly timeless,
            while Laufey’s conversational lyrics give her music
           a relatability to the next generation of jazz and classical aficionados.  
        
        Laufey’s self-assured musicianship and deeply felt lyrics take the idea of “classic” music,
         whether it’s slotted as classical or jazz—or even chart-topping pop—and humanize it, creating a deep-seated
         connection with listeners that goes deeper than hitting “play” on a streaming service.
          “There are very few examples of artists who are onstage with an orchestra one day and making TikToks the next,” 
         she notes dryly. Laufey’s straddling of those two worlds has put her in a singular place 
         across music, and with Bewitched, she’s ready to ascend to the next level.  </pre>
